            <p>I created Dragon Adventure Bonanza (DAB) as a part of a video game programming course where we worked in groups, building everything from the game engine and rendering system to a fully featured multi-level platform game. DAB was elected as the best in the class by an industry panel and most fun by popular vote!</p>
